/**
 * `ToolRegistry` — the loop-facing entry point to the tool catalog
 *
 * A `Registry` is a plain immutable value (like {@link Executor}, not a service): a catalog
 * of {@link RegisteredTool}s plus a `resolve` that produces a frozen {@link Resolved}
 * snapshot. The registry **catalogs** tools and produces snapshots; it does **not** execute
 * them — execution lives on the resolved snapshot (`resolved.handle`), backed by the
 * `Executor`.
 *
 * Because a tool's capability `R` is discharged at registration (`Tool.provide` → a
 * `RegisteredTool` whose only residual requirement is the executor-provided `ToolProgress`),
 * `Registry` / `Resolved` are **non-generic** — so any number of tools (built-in or
 * third-party/plugin) compose without a shared capability union.
