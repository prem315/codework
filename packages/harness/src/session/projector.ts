/*
 * @file Registers the durable-input projectors with the event service.
 *
 * Provides no service. Its only purpose is the registration side effect, which
 * must happen exactly once and before anything publishes -- `Layer` gives both,
 * because a layer is built once per graph, at startup.
 *
 * Registering from `SessionInput.make` instead would run once per consumer, and
 * a projector registered twice runs twice on one event: the second insert hits
 * ON CONFLICT, raises LifecycleConflict inside the commit, and rolls the event
 * back. Every admission would fail, blaming a conflict that does not exist.
 *
 * Nothing type-errors if this layer is left out of the graph. `admit` publishes
 * happily and writes no row, so the wiring is worth asserting in a test.
 *
 * Only durable definitions are registered here, and that is not a stylistic
 * choice: `Event.project` hands its callback to `commitDurableEvent`, which only
 * runs for events that have a transaction. Registering a projector for a live
 * definition -- any `session.llm.*` except the two terminals -- compiles, looks
 * wired, and never fires.
 *
 * Live events are not lost, they take the other path. `notify` publishes every
 * event to the typed and firehose pubsubs, so deltas and block boundaries are
 * already streaming; what does not exist yet is a `subscribe` on
 * `Event.Interface` for a consumer to read them from. That is the hook a future
 * streamer wants -- a stream it subscribes to, not a callback per event type --
 * so nothing needs registering here for it.
