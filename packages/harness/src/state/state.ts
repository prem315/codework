/*
 * @file Runtime state for one exchange.
 *
 * State answers "what is this agent, right now": its system prompt, its tool
 * set, and the provider options a request is built from. It is captured once per
 * exchange and pinned for every turn inside it, so a turn's continuations all
 * see the same prompt and the same tools.
 *
 * State is not conversation. `Context.Service` owns the durable transcript and
 * is reassembled every turn; State is reassembled between exchanges. The two are
 * siblings and neither reads the other -- an LLM request is their pure
 * combination.
 *
 * State reads the mount; it never acquires one. `snapshot` therefore declares
 * `SandboxIO.Provides | Location.Service` in its requirements, which makes
 * "mount first" a type-level fact: the method cannot be called outside a session
 * drain. That is the same trick `Location.layer` uses one level down.
