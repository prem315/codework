/*
 * @file Pure system-prompt construction.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a service, a clock, or a filesystem. Given the same inputs
 * it returns the same string, byte for byte -- which is what lets the prompt be
 * asserted in a test and cached by a provider across a turn's continuations.
 *
 * The chain has three caller slots (§6.1 of the design notes):
 *
 *   foundation --promptCustom?--> base
 *     -> tools + guidelines
 *     -> promptSystemAppend
 *     -> working directory
 *     -> promptSystemOverride(rendered) -> final
 *
 * `promptSystemOverride` is applied by the caller of {@link build}, not here: it
 * may be async, and this module stays pure.
